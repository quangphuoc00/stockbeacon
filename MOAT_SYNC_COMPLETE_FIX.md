# Moat Score Synchronization - Complete Fix

## The Problem
- Moat Analysis tab showed 78/100
- Overview tab showed 18/20 (which corresponds to 90/100)
- The cached StockBeacon score was calculated with an older moat analysis

## The Solution

### 1. Automatic Mismatch Detection
Added logic to detect when the cached score's moat doesn't match the current moat analysis:
```typescript
// In StockDataService
if (score && moatAnalysis) {
  const expectedMoatScore = Math.round((moatAnalysis.overallScore / 100) * 20)
  if (score.moatScore !== expectedMoatScore) {
    // Force recalculation
    score = null
  }
}
```

### 2. Score Recalculation
When a mismatch is detected:
- The old score is discarded
- A new score is calculated with the current moat analysis
- The new score is cached

### 3. Cache Management
- Created endpoint to clear score cache: `/api/stocks/[symbol]/clear-score-cache`
- Updated caching logic to save recalculated scores

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear the old cached score
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/AAPL/clear-score-cache
```

### Step 2: Refresh the stock page
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/stocks/AAPL (or refresh if already there)

### Step 3: Check the logs
You should see in the terminal:
```
[StockDataService] Checking for cached moat analysis: moat_analysis:AAPL
[StockDataService] Found cached moat analysis for AAPL, score: 78/100
[StockBeaconScore] Calculating score for AAPL:
  - AI Moat Analysis: Yes (78/100)
  - Moat Score: 16/20
[StockDataService] Updating cached score for AAPL with moat: 16/20
```

### Step 4: Verify synchronization
- Overview tab: Competitive Moat should show **16/20**
- Moat Analysis tab: Should show **78/100**
- Formula check: 78 ÷ 100 × 20 = 15.6 ≈ 16 ✓

## How It Works Now

1. **Page Load**: 
   - Fetches cached moat analysis (78/100)
   - Fetches cached score
   - Detects mismatch (score has 18/20 but moat is 78/100)
   - Recalculates score with current moat
   - Updates cache with new score (16/20)

2. **Subsequent Loads**:
   - Both values are synchronized from cache
   - No recalculation needed

3. **When Moat Analysis Changes**:
   - Automatic detection and recalculation
   - Ensures consistency across all views

## Manual Cache Management

If needed, you can manually clear caches:
```bash
# Clear score cache for a specific symbol
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/AAPL/clear-score-cache

# Force refresh moat analysis
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/AAPL/moat?refresh=true"
```
