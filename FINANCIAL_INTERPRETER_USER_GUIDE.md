## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Re-analyze quarterly after earnings
2. **Holistic View**: Consider analysis alongside other factors
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Match investments to your risk profile
4. **Diversification**: Don't rely on single stock analysis

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

```json
// Non-US Company
{
  "error": "Not a US-listed company",
  "message": "Financial analysis is available for US-listed companies only"
}

// Invalid Symbol

  "error": "Not a US-listed company",
  "message": "Financial analysis is available for US-listed companies only"
}

// Temporary Error
{

}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Caching**: Results cached for 4 hours
2. **Batch Requests**: Space out multiple requests
3. **Error Retry**: Wait 30 seconds before retrying failed requests

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```typescript
async function analyzeStock(symbol: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/stocks/${symbol}/analysis`);
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    console.error(`Analysis failed: ${error.message}`);
    return null;
  }
  
  const analysis = await response.json();
  
  // Check investment suitability
  if (analysis.summary.investmentSuitability.conservative) {
    console.log(`${symbol} suitable for conservative investors`);
  }
  
  // Display health score
  console.log(`Health Score: ${analysis.healthScore.overall} (${analysis.healthScore.grade})`);
  
  // Show top recommendation
  if (analysis.recommendations.length > 0) {
    const topRec = analysis.recommendations[0];
    console.log(`Action: ${topRec.title} - ${topRec.description}`);
  }
  
  return analysis;
}
```

### Python
```python
import requests

def analyze_stock(symbol):
    response = requests.get(f'http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/{symbol}/analysis')
    
    if response.status_code == 404:
        print(f"{symbol} is not a US-listed company")
        return None
        
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error analyzing {symbol}")
        return None
        
    analysis = response.json()
    
    # Display summary
    print(f"{symbol} Analysis:")
    print(f"Health Score: {analysis['healthScore']['overall']} ({analysis['healthScore']['grade']})")
    print(f"Rating: {analysis['summary']['simpleRating']}")
    print(f"Summary: {analysis['summary']['oneLineSummary']}")
    
    # Check red flags
    if analysis['redFlagsCount'] > 0:
        print(f"\nWarning: {analysis['redFlagsCount']} red flags detected:")
        for flag in analysis['topRedFlags']:
            print(f"- {flag['title']}: {flag['explanation']}")
    
    return analysis
