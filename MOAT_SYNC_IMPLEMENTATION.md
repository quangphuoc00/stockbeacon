# Moat Score Synchronization Implementation

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: Overview tab showed moat score of 18/20 while Moat Analysis tab showed 78/100
- **Cause**: Different data sources - cached StockBeacon score vs fresh AI moat analysis
- **Solution**: Both tabs now use the same cached moat analysis data

## Changes Made

### 1. Stock Page Server-Side Fetching
- `/src/app/(protected)/stocks/[symbol]/page.tsx`
- Now fetches cached moat analysis on server side
- Passes it to client as initial data

### 2. StockDataService Enhancement
- `/src/lib/services/stock-data.service.ts`
- Checks for cached moat analysis before calculating scores
- Includes AI moat analysis in StockBeacon score calculation
- Ensures consistency between Overview and Moat Analysis tabs

### 3. Shared Redis Instance
- `/src/lib/utils/redis.ts`
- Created singleton Redis instance to avoid multiple connections
- Used across all services for better performance

## Technical Details

### Cache Configuration
- **Key Format**: `moat_analysis:SYMBOL`
- **TTL**: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- **Storage**: Upstash Redis

### Data Flow
1. User visits stock page
2. Server checks Redis for cached moat analysis
3. If found, passes to client with initial data
4. StockBeacon score calculation uses same cached moat
5. Both tabs display consistent information

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Visit a stock detail page
2. Note the Competitive Moat score in Overview (e.g., 18/20)
3. Click on Moat Analysis tab
4. Verify the score shown (should be 90/100 for 18/20)
5. The conversion formula: `moatScore/20 = overallScore/100`

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: Same moat score across all views
- **Performance**: Reduced API calls, faster page loads
- **Reliability**: Single source of truth for moat analysis
- **Caching**: 24-hour cache reduces AI API usage
