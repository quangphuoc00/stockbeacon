## Core Components

### 1. Main Interpreter Service

```typescript
interface FinancialInterpreter {
  analyze(financialStatements: FinancialStatements, options?: AnalysisOptions): Promise<InterpretationReport>
  compareCompanies(companies: Company[], options?: ComparisonOptions): Promise<ComparisonReport>
  generateInsights(report: InterpretationReport): ActionableInsights[]
}

interface InterpretationReport {
  symbol: string

}
```

## Confidence Scoring System

### Overview

Each analysis includes a confidence score (0-100%) indicating data reliability and completeness. Higher scores mean more accurate analysis.

### Confidence Score Structure

```typescript
interface ConfidenceScore {
  score: number // 0-100
  level: 'high' | 'good' | 'moderate' | 'low'
  factors: ConfidenceFactor[]
  improvements: ImprovementSuggestion[]
}

interface ConfidenceFactor {
  name: string
  impact: number // How much this affects confidence
  status: 'available' | 'missing' | 'partial'
  description: string
}

interface ImprovementSuggestion {
  action: string
  impact: string // e.g., "+15% confidence"
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'moderate' | 'hard'
  dataSource: string
}
```

### Confidence Levels (US Stocks with SEC EDGAR)

  - 5 years annual + 8 quarters of history
  
- **Enhanced Confidence (95-100%)**: When adding contextual data
  - 10-K/10-Q footnotes for debt schedules, segment details
  - MD&A for management insights
  - Industry comparisons for relative performance

### Visual Confidence Indicators

```typescript
interface ConfidenceDisplay {
  visualIndicator: string // "🟢 95%" or "🟡 75%" or "🔴 65%"
  progressBar: {
    filled: number // percentage
    color: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red'
  }
  tooltip: string // Hover text explaining confidence
}
```

## Beginner Translation Layer

### Translation Principles

1. **Use Everyday Analogies**
   - Current Ratio = "Money in wallet vs bills to pay"
   - Debt-to-Equity = "Mortgage size vs home equity"
   - Inventory Turnover = "How fast products fly off shelves"

2. **Visual Indicators**
   - 🟢 Green = Good/Positive
   - 🟡 Yellow = Caution/Monitor
   - 🔴 Red = Warning/Negative
   - 📈 Improving trend
   - 📉 Declining trend
   - ➡️ Stable/Flat trend

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Level 1: Simple verdict (Good/Bad/Okay)
   - Level 2: Plain English explanation
   - Level 3: Specific numbers and context
   - Level 4: Technical details for advanced users

### Example Translations

```typescript
interface BeginnerTranslations {
  negativeFreeCashFlow: {
    technical: "FCF < 0",
    beginner: "Company spending more than earning - like using credit cards to pay bills",
    context: "Okay if investing for growth, bad if just surviving",
    action: "Check if temporary (new factory) or chronic (losing money)"
  },
  
  highROIC: {
    technical: "ROIC > 20%",
    beginner: "Earns $20 for every $100 invested - better than most investments!",
    context: "Sign of competitive advantage and good management",
    action: "Great companies maintain high ROIC over time"
  },
  
  deterioratingWorkingCapital: {
    technical: "NWC declining, CCC increasing",
    beginner: "Money getting stuck in the business - like unpaid IOUs piling up",
    context: "Cash tied up in inventory or waiting for customer payments",
    action: "Watch for liquidity issues if trend continues"
  }
}
```
