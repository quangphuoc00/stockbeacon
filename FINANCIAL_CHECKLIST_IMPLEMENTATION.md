# Financial Health Checklist Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive Financial Health Checklist that replaces the previous Overview tab in the financial analysis section. This new checklist provides a transparent, educational view of all financial health checks performed on a company.

## Features

### 1. **Six Check Categories**
- **Solvency & Liquidity**: Can the company pay its bills and survive?
- **Consistent Growth**: Is the company growing sustainably?
- **Profitability & Margins**: Is the company making money efficiently?
- **Financial Strength**: How strong is the balance sheet?
- **Quality & Efficiency**: How well-run is the company?
- **Shareholder Value**: Does the company reward shareholders?

### 2. **25+ Individual Checks**
Each category contains 4-5 specific checks, including:
- Insolvency Risk Check
- Liquidity Crisis Check
- Revenue/Profit/Cash Flow Growth
- Margin Analysis
- Debt Levels and Coverage
- Earnings Quality
- Share Dilution/Buybacks
- And many more...

### 3. **Visual Status Indicators**
- ✅ **Pass**: Green checkmark for healthy metrics
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Yellow alert for metrics needing attention
- ❌ **Fail**: Red X for concerning metrics

### 4. **Detailed Explanations**
Each check includes an explanation dialog with:
- **What We're Checking**: Clear description of the metric
- **The Numbers**: Actual financial data and calculations
- **Plain English**: Beginner-friendly explanation with analogies
- **Why It Matters**: Context on importance
- **Recommendation**: Actionable advice

      { label: 'Current Ratio', value: '0.85' }
    ],
