# Project Overview: StockBeacon
**Domain**: StockBeacon.app  
**Tagline**: "Your beacon in the stock market storm"

You are building a stock signal platform, where beginner users can get signal buy and sell stock without knowing a lot of knowledge or financial term

**DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY**: Unlike competitors (Motley Fool, Simply Wall St, Finviz), focus on ACTIONABLE SIGNALS rather than data overload. Think "Netflix recommendations for stocks" - simple, personalized, confidence-inspiring.

You will be using Next JS, shadcn, tailwind, Lucid icon

## Key Competitive Advantages to Emphasize:
1. **Simplicity Without Dumbing Down**: Competitors overwhelm beginners with charts/data
2. **All-in-One Signal**: Combine fundamental + technical + sentiment in ONE clear score
3. **Plain English Explanations**: No financial jargon, explain WHY a stock is good
4. **Timing-Focused**: Most platforms analyze, we tell WHEN to act
5. **Confidence Building**: Show success rate of past signals to build user trust

# Core functionalities
1. Stock Screener: Show the list of stock symbols which are identified as a great business & at good time to buy
    
    **STANDOUT FEATURE**: Use a simple "StockBeacon Score" (0-100) that combines all factors below. Competitors show raw data - we show ONE clear number with color coding (Green/Yellow/Red).
    
    Great business when a company has all of these checks
        - Big pecentage of insider ownership **[EXPLAIN: "Management owns skin in the game"]**
        - Long term debt < 3x Net earning (after tax) **[EXPLAIN: "Company isn't drowning in debt"]**
        - Strong moat based on brand loyalty, high switching costs, pricing power (important) **[EXPLAIN: "Has unfair advantages competitors can't copy"]**
        - Consistent growth: Cashflow, Revenue, Profit **[EXPLAIN: "Growing predictably, not just lucky"]**
        - No cyclid & overly volatile **[EXPLAIN: "Steady business, not a roller coaster"]**
        - 12 - 15% ROE & > 7% ROA => This means effective capital use & sustainable profitability **[EXPLAIN: "Makes money efficiently with what they have"]**
    
    **UX INNOVATION**: Show max 10 stocks at a time with "Why Now?" explanations. Competitors show hundreds - we curate quality.

2. Stock Details: Show these information to that screen
    
    **DIFFERENTIATION**: Present as "Investment Health Report" - like a doctor's checkup for stocks. Use visual health indicators (‚úÖ‚ùå‚ö†Ô∏è) instead of raw numbers.
    
    a/ fundamental checklist **[PRESENT AS: "Business Quality Score"]**
        - Insider ownership **[SHOW AS: Visual bar with "Management Confidence Level"]**
        - Long-term debt (Ideal: < 3 x Net earning) **[SHOW AS: "Debt Safety Rating" with traffic light colors]**
        - Moat (Strong, normal, weak) & explaination based on these factor: brand localty, high switching costs, pricing power **[SHOW AS: "Competitive Advantage Strength" with castle icon metaphor]**
        - Consistent growth (Cashflow, Revenue, Profit) **[SHOW AS: "Growth Consistency Score" with trend arrows]**
        - ROE rating (ideal > 12%) **[SHOW AS: "Profit Efficiency Rating"]**
        - ROA rating (ideal > 7%) **[SHOW AS: "Asset Utilization Rating"]**
        - DCF price (ideal > 25% current stock) **[SHOW AS: "Value Opportunity %" with bargain/expensive labels]**
    
    b/ Support levels **[PRESENT AS: "Price Safety Net" with simple floor metaphor]**
    c/ Trend (uptrend, downtrend, sideway) **[SHOW AS: Momentum arrows with "Current Direction"]**
    d/ Latest news with the tags **[PRESENT AS: "Market Sentiment Radar"]**
        - Positive short term impact **[ICON: üöÄ "Short-term Boost"]**
        - Positive long term impact **[ICON: üìà "Long-term Strength"]**
        - Neutral **[ICON: ‚ûñ "No Major Impact"]**
        - Negative long term impact **[ICON: üìâ "Long-term Concern"]**
        - Negative short term impact **[ICON: ‚ö†Ô∏è "Short-term Headwind"]**
    
    **KEY INNOVATION**: One-click "Should I Buy?" button that explains the decision in 2-3 sentences. Competitors make users figure it out themselves.

3. Watchlist
    
    **STANDOUT FEATURE**: "Smart Alerts" - not just price alerts, but CONTEXT alerts. Example: "AAPL hit support level + positive earnings news + uptrend confirmed = BUY SIGNAL"
    
    a. Add stocks to watchlist so we can send the signal when to buy
        - Buy entry: Near support level, starting an uptrend, DCF > price **[PRESENT AS: "Perfect Storm Alert" when all 3 align]**
    
    **INNOVATION**: "Why I'm Waiting" explanations for each watchlist stock. Show users exactly what trigger you're waiting for, with progress bars.

4. Portfolio
    
    **MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR**: "Portfolio Health Monitor" - competitors track performance, we track RISK and suggest actions.
    
    a. Manage existing positions and average price **[SHOW AS: Position cards with current score vs. purchase score]**
    b. Buy power **[SHOW AS: "Opportunity Fund" with suggested allocation per signal strength]**
    c. Signal when to exit a stock **[PRESENT AS: "Exit Radar" with early warning system]**
        - Overvalue **[ALERT: "Price got ahead of fundamentals - consider taking profits"]**
        - Structural deterioration: Loss of competitive advantage, new strong competitor, regulation changes, shift of consumer behavior **[ALERT: "Business fundamentals deteriorating - consider exit"]**
        - Better opportunities **[ALERT: "Found better stocks with your criteria - consider rebalancing"]**
    
    **INNOVATION**: "Portfolio Report Card" - monthly summary showing what went right/wrong with past signals to build confidence and learning.

# Design Principles That Set Us Apart:

## 1. **Confidence-First Design**
- Always show WHY we're confident in a recommendation
- Use progress bars and scores instead of raw numbers
- Green = confident buy, Yellow = wait, Red = avoid (never confuse users)

## 2. **Context Over Data**
- Every number needs an explanation in plain English
- "ROE of 15%" becomes "Makes 15% profit on shareholder money (Excellent)"
- Show trends, not just snapshots

## 3. **Action-Oriented UX**
- Every screen should end with a clear next step
- "Buy", "Wait", "Research More", or "Avoid" - never leave users hanging
- Show consequences: "If you buy $1000 worth and we're right, you could gain $250 in 12 months"

## 4. **Learning Without Overwhelming**
- Optional "Learn More" expandable sections for curious users
- Glossary tooltips for financial terms
- Success/failure examples to build pattern recognition
