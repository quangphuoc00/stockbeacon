# StockBeacon Testing Strategy ðŸ§ª

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the StockBeacon application, ensuring reliability, performance, and quality across all components.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions, utilities, and service methods
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+
- **Files to Test**:
  - `/src/lib/services/*` - All service files
  - `/src/lib/utils/*` - Utility functions
  - `/src/lib/hooks/*` - Custom React hooks
  - StockBeacon Score calculations

### 2. Component Testing (React Testing Library)
- **Purpose**: Test React components in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 75%+
- **Components to Test**:
  - UI components (`/src/components/ui/*`)
  - Dashboard components
  - Stock cards and lists
  - Forms and input validation
  - Navigation components

### 3. Integration Testing (Jest + MSW)
- **Purpose**: Test API routes and database operations
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+
- **Areas to Test**:
  - API routes (`/src/app/api/*`)
  - Authentication flows
  - Database operations
  - Redis caching
  - External API integrations (Yahoo Finance)

### 4. End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
- **Coverage**: Critical paths
- **User Flows to Test**:
  - User registration and login
  - Stock search and analysis
  - Watchlist management
  - Portfolio operations
  - Stock screener usage
  - Dashboard interactions

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure fast load times and smooth interactions
- **Metrics**:
  - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
  - API response times
  - Bundle size analysis
  - Memory usage

### 6. Accessibility Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Tools**: axe-core, WAVE
- **Areas**:
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Color contrast
  - ARIA labels

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
- Centralized mock data in `/tests/fixtures`
- Consistent test user accounts
- Sample stock data for predictable testing

### Test Database
- Separate test database instance
- Automated seeding before tests
- Cleanup after test runs

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Run on every pull request
- Parallel test execution
- Code coverage reports
- Performance metrics tracking
- Deployment blocking on test failures

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Linting
- Type checking
- Unit test execution for changed files

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Run performance tests
npm run test:perf
```

```

## Testing Best Practices

### Do's
- Write tests before fixing bugs (TDD)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Mock external services
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use data-testid attributes for E2E selectors
- Test accessibility alongside functionality

### Don'ts
- Don't test implementation details
- Don't rely on test execution order
- Don't use production data in tests
- Don't skip flaky tests (fix them)
- Don't test third-party libraries

## Coverage Requirements

| Category | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Statements | 70% | 85% |
| Branches | 65% | 80% |
| Functions | 70% | 85% |
| Lines | 70% | 85% |

## Test Review Checklist

- [ ] All new features have corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Tests run in isolation
- [ ] No hardcoded values or magic numbers
- [ ] Mocks are properly cleaned up
- [ ] Tests complete within reasonable time (< 5s for unit, < 30s for E2E)

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Metrics to Track
- Test execution time trends
- Coverage trends
- Flaky test frequency
- Test failure patterns
- Performance regression detection

### Reporting Tools
- Jest coverage reports
- Playwright HTML reports
- GitHub Actions annotations
- Slack notifications for failures
- Weekly test health reports
